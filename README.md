## Ideas List - Please Add

Note - this is an un-moderated list - just collecting suggestions for now

## Turing

Docs for Hybrid Compute - Turing on Boba: https://docs.boba.network/turing

<h3 id="security--major-new-functionality">Security; Major new functionality</h3>

* Cross-chain bridging/fast exits using inclusion proofs from other chains to trigger changes on Boba

* 2FA on tx level

* Protect custom trading strategies by keeping key logic off-chain

* Build meta-transactions on Boba (with/without Turing)

* Build on-chain(contract level) name resolver with Turing (ENS, Unstoppable Domains etc)

### DeFi

* Reduce slippage and increase performance of stable-swap algorithms by off-loading most of the math to Turing

<h3 id="education-gaming">Education/Gaming</h3>

* An *educational* app where you get badges for completing certain tasks or puzzles

* PvP NFT battle game using Turing VRF to determine NFT traits e.g. armor rank, weapon rank etc - earn WAGMI by PVPing
Players can pick PvP or PvE on a simple map in browser (kinda like super mario land map)

* Boba Chess?

### Buy real things with Crypto

* Participate in eBay auctions via smart contracts

<h3 id="irl--crypto--rewards--motivation">IRL<>Crypto; Rewards; Motivation</h3>

* Integrate real-world events with a crypto settlement layer - any service that exposes an API can now be connected to on-chain settlements (Social Networking, Music, Games)

* Memorialize in-game events and milestones with game-status NFTs

* An app that *motivates* you to get up early or focus on things. Users deposit tokens to participate and get reward if they achieve some milestones, like getting up early for 30 days.

* An app that requires users to click a button every day and watch an *advertisement*. Once they continuously do it for 30 days, they get some Boba tokens back.

* Users *test* apps, find bugs, open PRs, and get Boba as the reward

### Creative Content

* Generate video and audio based on on-chain inputs and sell and share the content

* Build on-chain versions of Tik-Tok and Facebook

* *Surveys* can be on-chain/decentralized to some degree

* Generative art on L2 blocks/ block-time/ commit roots etc
